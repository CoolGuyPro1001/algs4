/**
 *  The {@code WeightedQuickUnionUF} class represents a <em>union–find data type</em>
 *  (also known as the <em>disjoint-sets data type</em>).
 *  It supports the classic <em>union</em> and <em>find</em> operations,
 *  along with a <em>count</em> operation that returns the total number
 *  of sets.
 *  <p>
 *  The union–find data type models a collection of sets containing
 *  <em>n</em> elements, with each element in exactly one set.
 *  The elements are named 0 through <em>n</em>–1.
 *  Initially, there are <em>n</em> sets, with each element in its
 *  own set. The <em>canonical element</em> of a set
 *  (also known as the <em>root</em>, <em>identifier</em>,
 *  <em>leader</em>, or <em>set representative</em>)
 *  is one distinguished element in the set. Here is a summary of
 *  the operations:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li><em>find</em>(<em>p</em>) returns the canonical element
 *      of the set containing <em>p</em>. The <em>find</em> operation
 *      returns the same value for two elements if and only if
 *      they are in the same set.
 *  <li><em>union</em>(<em>p</em>, <em>q</em>) merges the set
 *      containing element <em>p</em> with the set containing
 *      element <em>q</em>. That is, if <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>
 *      are in different sets, replace these two sets
 *      with a new set that is the union of the two.
 *  <li><em>count</em>() returns the number of sets.
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  The canonical element of a set can change only when the set
 *  itself changes during a call to <em>union</em>&mdash;it cannot
 *  change during a call to either <em>find</em> or <em>count</em>.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses <em>weighted quick union by size</em>
 *  (without path compression).
 *  The constructor takes &Theta;(<em>n</em>), where <em>n</em>
 *  is the number of elements.
 *  The <em>union</em> and <em>find</em>
 *  operations  take &Theta;(log <em>n</em>) time in the worst
 *  case. The <em>count</em> operation takes &Theta;(1) time.
 *  <p>
 *  For alternative implementations of the same API, see
 *  {@link UF}, {@link QuickFindUF}, and {@link QuickUnionUF}.
 *  For additional documentation, see
 *  <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf">Section 1.5</a> of
