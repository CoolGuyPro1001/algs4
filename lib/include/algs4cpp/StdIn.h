/**
 *  The {@code StdIn} class provides static methods for reading strings
 *  and numbers from standard input.
 *  These functions fall into one of four categories:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>those for reading individual tokens from standard input, one at a time,
 *      and converting each to a number, string, or boolean
 *  <li>those for reading characters from standard input, one at a time
 *  <li>those for reading lines from standard input, one at a time
 *  <li>those for reading a sequence of values of the same type from standard input,
 *      and returning the values in an array
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  Generally, it is best not to mix functions from the different
 *  categories in the same program.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Getting started.</b>
 *  To use this class, you must have {@code StdIn.class} in your
 *  Java classpath. If you used our autoinstaller, you should be all set.
 *  Otherwise, either download
 *  <a href = "https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/code/stdlib.jar">stdlib.jar</a>
 *  and add to your Java classpath or download
 *  <a href = "https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdIn.java">StdIn.java</a>
 *  and put a copy in your working directory.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Reading tokens from standard input and converting to numbers and strings.</b>
 *  You can use the following methods to read numbers, strings, and booleans
 *  from standard input one at a time:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> {@link #isEmpty()}
 *  <li> {@link #readInt()}
 *  <li> {@link #readDouble()}
 *  <li> {@link #readString()}
 *  <li> {@link #readShort()}
 *  <li> {@link #readLong()}
 *  <li> {@link #readFloat()}
 *  <li> {@link #readByte()}
 *  <li> {@link #readBoolean()}
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  The first method returns true if standard input has no more tokens.
 *  Each other method skips over any input that is whitespace. Then, it reads
 *  the next token and attempts to convert it into a value of the specified
 *  type. If it succeeds, it returns that value; otherwise, it
 *  throws an {@link InputMismatchException}.
 *  <p>
 *  <em>Whitespace</em> includes spaces, tabs, and newlines; the full definition
 *  is inherited from {@link Character#isWhitespace(char)}.
 *  A <em>token</em> is a maximal sequence of non-whitespace characters.
 *  The precise rules for describing which tokens can be converted to
 *  integers and floating-point numbers are inherited from
 *  <a href = "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html#number-syntax">Scanner</a>,
 *  using the locale {@link Locale#US}; the rules
 *  for floating-point numbers are slightly different
 *  from those in {@link Double#valueOf(String)},
 *  but unlikely to be of concern to most programmers.
 *  <p>
 *  As an example, the following code fragment reads integers from standard input,
 *  one at a time, and prints them one per line.
 *  <pre>
 *  while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) {
 *      double value = StdIn.readDouble();
 *      StdOut.println(value);
 *  }
 *  </pre>
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Reading characters from standard input.</b>
 *  You can use the following two methods to read characters from standard input one at a time:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> {@link #hasNextChar()}
 *  <li> {@link #readChar()}
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  The first method returns true if standard input has more input (including whitespace).
 *  The second method reads and returns the next character of input on standard
 *  input (possibly a whitespace character).
 *  <p>
 *  As an example, the following code fragment reads characters from standard input,
 *  one character at a time, and prints it to standard output.
 *  <pre>
 *  while (StdIn.hasNextChar()) {
 *      char c = StdIn.readChar();
 *      StdOut.print(c);
 *  }
 *  </pre>
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Reading lines from standard input.</b>
 *  You can use the following two methods to read lines from standard input:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> {@link #hasNextLine()}
 *  <li> {@link #readLine()}
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  The first method returns true if standard input has more input (including whitespace).
 *  The second method reads and returns the remaining portion of
 *  the next line of input on standard input (possibly whitespace),
 *  discarding the trailing line separator.
 *  <p>
 *  A <em>line separator</em> is defined to be one of the following strings:
 *  {@code \n} (Linux), {@code \r} (old Macintosh),
 *  {@code \r\n} (Windows),
 *  {@code \}{@code u2028}, {@code \}{@code u2029}, or {@code \}{@code u0085}.
 *  <p>
 *  As an example, the following code fragment reads text from standard input,
 *  one line at a time, and prints it to standard output.
 *  <pre>
 *  while (StdIn.hasNextLine()) {
 *      String line = StdIn.readLine();
 *      StdOut.println(line);
 *  }
 *  </pre>
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Reading a sequence of values of the same type from standard input.</b>
 *  You can use the following methods to read a sequence numbers, strings,
 *  or booleans (all of the same type) from standard input:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> {@link #readAllDoubles()}
 *  <li> {@link #readAllInts()}
 *  <li> {@link #readAllLongs()}
 *  <li> {@link #readAllStrings()}
 *  <li> {@link #readAllLines()}
 *  <li> {@link #readAll()}
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  The first three methods read of all of remaining token on standard input
 *  and converts the tokens to values of
 *  the specified type, as in the corresponding
 *  {@code readDouble}, {@code readInt}, and {@code readString()} methods.
 *  The {@code readAllLines()} method reads all remaining lines on standard
 *  input and returns them as an array of strings.
 *  The {@code readAll()} method reads all remaining input on standard
 *  input and returns it as a string.
 *  <p>
 *  As an example, the following code fragment reads all of the remaining
 *  tokens from standard input and returns them as an array of strings.
 *  <pre>
 *  std::vector<std::string> words = StdIn::readAllStrings();
 *  </pre>
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Differences with Scanner.</b>
 *  {@code StdIn} and {@link Scanner} are both designed to parse
 *  tokens and convert them to primitive types and strings.
 *  The main differences are summarized below:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> {@code StdIn} is a set of static methods and reads
 *       reads input from only standard input. It is suitable for use before
 *       a programmer knows about objects.
 *       See {@link In} for an object-oriented version that handles
 *       input from files, URLs,
 *       and sockets.
 *  <li> {@code StdIn} uses whitespace as the delimiter pattern
 *       that separates tokens.
 *       {@link Scanner} supports arbitrary delimiter patterns.
 *  <li> {@code StdIn} coerces the character-set encoding to UTF-8,
 *       which is the most widely used character encoding for Unicode.
 *  <li> {@code StdIn} coerces the locale to {@link Locale#US},
 *       for consistency with {@link StdOut}, {@link Double#parseDouble(String)},
 *       and floating-point literals.
 *  <li> {@code StdIn} has convenient methods for reading a single
 *       character; reading in sequences of integers, doubles, or strings;
 *       and reading in all of the remaining input.
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  Historical note: {@code StdIn} preceded {@code Scanner}; when
 *  {@code Scanner} was introduced, this class was re-implemented to use {@code Scanner}.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Using standard input.</b>
 *  Standard input is a fundamental operating system abstraction on Mac OS X,
 *  Windows, and Linux.
 *  The methods in {@code StdIn} are <em>blocking</em>, which means that they
 *  will wait until you enter input on standard input.
 *  If your program has a loop that repeats until standard input is empty,
 *  you must signal that the input is finished.
 *  To do so, depending on your operating system and IDE,
 *  use either {@code <Ctrl-d>} or {@code <Ctrl-z>}, on its own line.
 *  If you are redirecting standard input from a file, you will not need
 *  to do anything to signal that the input is finished.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Known bugs.</b>
 *  Java's UTF-8 encoding does not recognize the optional
 *  <a href = "http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4508058">byte-order mask</a>.
 *  If the input begins with the optional byte-order mask, {@code StdIn}
 *  will have an extra character {@code \}{@code uFEFF} at the beginning.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Reference.</b>
 *  For additional documentation,
 *  see <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/15inout">Section 1.5</a> of
